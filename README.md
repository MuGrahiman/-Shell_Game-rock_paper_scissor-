# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" written in Python.

## How to Play

To play the game:

1. Run the `shell_Game()` function in the Python environment.
2. You will be prompted to enter a choice: 0 for "Stone", 1 for "Paper", or 2 for "Scissor".
3. After making your choice, the game declares the winner for that round.
4. The game continues for the specified number of attempts, and then the final scores are displayed.
5. At the end of the game, you'll have the option to play again.

## Code Structure

The game is implemented using Python and consists of two main functions:

1. `run_game(atmpt)`: This function allows the player to input their choice and then compares it with the computer's choice to determine the winner for that round.
2. `shell_Game()`: This function manages the overall game flow, handling the number of attempts, scoring, and prompting for a rematch.

## Running the Game

To run the game:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided Python code into a file (e.g., `rps_game.py`).
3. Run the file using your preferred Python environment.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
